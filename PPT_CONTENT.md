# 📊 Slide: E2E Trust Workflow (ProcureChain)

**Title**: The 5-Step Secure Procurement Cycle

1.  **AI-Verified Listing**
    *   Farmer lists crop; AI Agent cross-checks price with Agmarknet API to prevent inflation.

2.  **Sealed Bidding Protocol**
    *   Vendors submit encrypted bids. Prices remain **Hidden On-Chain** until the deadline.

3.  **Governance & Validation**
    *   Smart Contract enforces strict deadlines and rejects invalid bids automatically.

4.  **Authorized Fund Release**
    *   **The Procurement Officer** acts as the final authority. They verify the physical goods and digitally sign to release the payment.

5.  **Forensic Audit Trail**
    *   The entire lifecycle is completely immutable. Auditors can mathematically verify any transaction years later.
